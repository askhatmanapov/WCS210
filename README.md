# How to compile C++ code in Visual Studio Code
## Group 4
### Introduction:
Welcome to this technical instruction on how to install a debugger! A debugger is a software tool that allows you to test and debug your code to ensure that it functions correctly. In this instruction, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of installing a debugger on your computer. This instruction is designed for Computer Science students who may not have prior experience with debugger installation. We will use clear and concise language and provide visual aids to help you easily follow along. By the end of this instruction, you will be able to successfully install a debugger on your computer and begin debugging your code with confidence. 
### Let's get started:
Prerequisites: 
1. A C++ compiler: Before you can start debugging your C++ code, you need to have a compiler installed on your computer. There are many options available for C++ compilers, such as GCC, Clang, and Visual C++. You should choose a compiler that is compatible with the debugger you plan to use.
2. You will need a program that allows you to write and edit C++ code. In our case it is a full-featured IDE like Visual Studio Code. You should know how to do basic things in VS Code (open folder, create new file).
3. A basic understanding of C++ programming: In order to effectively debug your C++ code, you should have a basic understanding of C++ programming concepts and syntax.
